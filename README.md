# NAME

uni - command-line utility to find or display Unicode characters

# DESCRIPTION

    $ uni ¬∂
    ¬∂ - U+0000B6 - PILCROW SIGN [Po]

```uni``` will output information from the Unicode DB in Raku; The hex code, the character itself, the characters name, and the properties of the character(s) are output.

This verison of uni is *heavily* inspired by the Perl 5 module of the same name. H/T to RJBS.

Since it's in Raku - you get the latest Unicode DB in the compiler (15 in the upcoming release)
and regexes are Raku-style.

# MODES

## Default

If you pass a single character to ```uni```, then details of that character are printed; Otherwise the codepoint names are searched.

## -s (Single Character)

A single character is processed.

    $ uni -s ‚Ä¢
    ‚Ä¢ - U+002022 - BULLET [Po]

## -v (Verbose, Single Character)

Identical to the `-s` variant, except that additional information about the codepoint is also displayed.

    $ uni -v üöÆ
    üöÆ - U+01F6AE - PUT LITTER IN ITS PLACE SYMBOL [So]
        Properties:       Symbol, other
        Unicode Script:   Common
        Unicode Block:    Transport and Map Symbols
        Added in Unicode: 6.0
        White Space:      False
        Width:            W

## -n (Name Search)

The text following -n is used to search (case insensitively) through all the codepoints. Parameters that start and end with ```/``` are considered regular expressions.

    $ uni -n modeÔ¨Üy # note the Ô¨Ü ligature
    ‰∑é - U+004DCE - HEXAGRAM FOR MODESTY [So]

    $ uni -n stroke dotl modifier
    ·∂° - U+001DA1 - MODIFIER LETTER SMALL DOTLESS J WITH STROKE [Lm]

    $ uni -n /"rev".*"pilcr"/ # note, has to be one shell arg
    ‚Åã - U+00204B - REVERSED PILCROW SIGN [Po]

## -w (Word Search)

Same as -n, except each parameter must match an entire word.

    $ uni -w cat eyes
    üò∏ - U+001F638 - GRINNING CAT FACE WITH SMILING EYES [So]
    üòª - U+001F63B - SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES [So]
    üòΩ - U+001F63D - KISSING CAT FACE WITH CLOSED EYES [So]

## -c (Multiple Characters)

Output multiple characters' information at once:

    $ uni -c ¬£¬¢‚Ä¶
    ¬£ - U+0000A3 - POUND SIGN [Sc]
    ¬¢ - U+0000A2 - CENT SIGN [Sc]
    ‚Ä¶ - U+002026 - HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS [Po]

## -u (Codepoint)

Search by hex codepoint:

    $ uni -u 221E 00A7
    ‚àû - U+00221E - INFINITY [Sm]
    ¬ß - U+0000A7 - SECTION SIGN [Po]

## -b (Bunny)

Given a character, generate a bunny holding the character:

    # uni -b 221E
